This is a web app to help people pace themselves during tests. Input the number of questions and the length of the test in minutes and the app will show a timer displaying the amount of time left on the test and on the current question. After completing a question, tap the next question button and the amount of time left for the following questions will be recalculated based on the number of questions remaining and the amount of time left.
