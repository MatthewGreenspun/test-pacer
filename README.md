# Test Pacer

This is a web app to help people pace themselves during tests. Input the amount of questions and the amount of minutes and the app will show a timer displaying the amount of time left in the test and on the question. After you complete a question, tab the next question button and the amount of time left for the following questions will be recalculated based on the amount of questions left and the amount of time left.

This app can be used [here](https://matthewgreenspun.github.io/test-pacer)

It is also an installable pwa.
